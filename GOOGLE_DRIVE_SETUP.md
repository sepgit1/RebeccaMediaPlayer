## Step 7: Integrate Into App

2. It will automatically:

   - Sync comments to Google Drive
   - Load data from any device
   - Keep everything in a folder called "Becca Music Player"

## How It Works

- **Automatic Cloud Backup**: Every time you add/remove songs or post comments
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Access your playlists on phone, tablet, or computer
- **Offline Mode**: App works offline, syncs when connected
- **Secure**: Uses Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication

## What Gets Synced

âœ… **Playlists** - All songs and videos
âœ… **Comments** - All comments on songs
âœ… **Settings** - Theme, colors, preferences
âœ… **Media History** - Songs you've played

## First Time Setup

1. When you first use the app, you'll be asked to:
   - Sign in with your Gmail account
   - Grant permission to access Google Drive
2. Click **"Allow"**
3. Your data will sync automatically!

## Questions?

If you need help:
1. Make sure your Client ID and API Key are correct
2. Check that Google Drive API is enabled
3. Verify the authorized URLs match your deployment
